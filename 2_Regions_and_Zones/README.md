# GCP Regions and Zones

- GCP is organized into **Regions** and **Zones**.
- Any Resource in Google Cloud can either be **Regional**, **Zonal** or **Global**.
  
### Zonal Resources
- Zonal resources operate within a single zone. Zonal outages can affect some or all of the resources in that zone.
  
### Regional Resources
- Regional Resources are redundantly deployed across multiple zones within a region.
