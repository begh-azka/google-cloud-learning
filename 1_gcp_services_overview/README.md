## Compute
1. Compute Engine:
- Google Compute Engine is an **IaaS** component of Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- Google Compute Engine enables users to launch **virtual machines** (VMs) on demand. VMs can be launched from the standard images or custom images created by users.
     
2. Google App Engine:
- App Engine is a fully managed, **serverless** platform for developing and hosting web applications at scale.
- Users can choose from several popular languages, libraries, and frameworks to develop their applications and then App Engine takes care of provisioning servers and scaling app instances based on demand. It is a **PaaS** for building scalable applications.

## Container Services
1. Google Kubernetes Engine:
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) offers a managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Google infrastructure.

## Developer Tools
1. Artifact Registry: 
- Artifact Registry is a service for managing container images and packages.
2. Cloud SDK
3. Deployment Manager
4. Cloud Source Repository
5. Cloud Test Lab

7. Cloud Deploy
  
## Serverless Computing
1. Cloud Functions: 
- Cloud Functions is a lightweight, event-based, asynchronous compute solution that allows you to create small, single-purpose functions that respond to cloud events without the need to manage a server or a runtime environment.
- It is a scalable pay-as-you-go function as a service (**FaaS**) offering to run the code with zero server management.
