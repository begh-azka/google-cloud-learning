# VPC
- **A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated private cloud hosted within a public cloud.**
- A VPC is a virtual network that closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center. After you create a VPC, you can add subnets.
- It runs on shared infrastructure like a public cloud does but isolates customers from each other.
- VPC resources are then reserved for use for each specific customer. The isolation creates a private and more secure public cloud.
