Created a VPC with three subnets.
Created instances in these subnets.

1. SSH
Tried to SSH into one. Failed as no rules are defines for the firewall. So access was blocked.
Created a firewall rule for port 22 and target can be any instances in a network or service accounts or network tags.
Source can be an IP range and/or a source tag or SA.
Destination does not need to be tampered with. It will match the target you specified once you create the rule.

2. ICMP
After connecting with the server, pinged other instances. It did not work as ICMP was not allowed.
Created a Firewall Rule and added icmp in the protocol option and kept source and target fields same as last rule.
